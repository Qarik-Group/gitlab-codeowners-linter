# gitlab-codeowners-linter
Keep your [Gitlab's CODEOWNERS file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html) up to date with this linter.

## Features
gitlab-codeowners-linter makes sure that the CODEOWNERS file is formatted respecting the following rules:
  - every section must be sorted alphabetically
  - within a section, paths must be ordered alphabetically
  - there must be no empty lines between paths

The linter can run in check or autofix mode.

## Usage
Install the library with
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Qarik-Group/gitlab-codeowners-linter.git
cd gitlab-codeowners-linter
pip install .
```

You need to pass the `--codeowners_file`  argument to the linter with the path to the CODEOWNERS file.
The linter by default will run in autofix mode. If you just want to check your file without modifying it use `--enable_autofix false`.

### Usage with pre-commit

You can use this linter with `pre-commit` by adding the following hook in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
repos:
- repo:  https://github.com/Qarik-Group/gitlab-codeowners-linter
  rev: v0.0.1
  hooks:
  - id:  gitlab-codeowners-linter
    args: ['--codeowners_file=path/to/your/CODEOWNERS/file']
```

## What's down the pipeline
* Check that all paths under a section are unique
* Check that paths exist
