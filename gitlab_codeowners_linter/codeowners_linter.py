# Gitlab CODEOWNERS linter
# What we want to check:
# The CODEOWNERS file must be formatted respecting the following rules:
#   - every section must be sorted alphabetically
#   - within a section, paths must be ordered alphabetically
#   - there must be no empty lines between paths
#   - paths in a section must be unique
#   - paths must exist
#   Note: there's the assumption that on the top of the file there are paths that
#       are not under any section. This may not be always true, like in a CODEOWNERS
#       file that only uses sections TODO: manage this corner case
#
